	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through technology. The ability to build something from scratch — whether it’s a website, application, or a system — and see it help people or improve processes excites me. I enjoy logical thinking, continuous learning, and the creativity involved in coding. Being a developer gives me the opportunity to innovate, collaborate, and contribute to something meaningful while constantly challenging myself to grow.</p>
